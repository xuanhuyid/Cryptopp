Task 3: RSA Cipher (Encryption/Decryption) using CryptoPP
Required:
+) Separation Encryption function and Decryption function (using switch case)
+) Plaintext (Encryption):
    - Support Vietnamese (UTF-16)
    - Input from screen or from file (using switch case)
+) Cyphertext (Decrytion):
    - Input from screen or from file (using switch case)
+) Secret key/public key
    - The keys load from files (for both two functions, using name of key)
    - The public key: >= 3072 bits
 +) OS platforms
  - Your code can compile on both Windows and Linux;
+) Performance (file word)
  - Report your hardware resources, OSs
  - Report computation performance for all operations on both Windows and Linux
    (multiple inputs with different sizes)

Task 4: ECC-based Digital signature with CryptoPP
Required:
+) Algorithm: ECDSA
+) Separation the signing function and the verify function (using switch case)
+) signing function; verify function
    - May adopt from library or direct compute from formulas. Deploy directly from formulas will get 10/100 bonus points. 
+) Message to sign: 
    - Input from file
    - Support Vietnamese (using UTF-16)
+) ECC curve:  should select from standard curves
+) Secret key/public key
    - The keys load from files (for both two functions)
    - The public key: >= 256 bits
+) OS platforms
  - Your code can compile on both Windows and Linux;
+) Performance
  - Report your hardware resources
  - Report computation performance for all operations on both Windows and Linux
